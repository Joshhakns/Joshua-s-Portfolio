# Description
## The motivation behind me doing this is so that I can learn the steps behind building my own basic website. While I know that this doens't seem like much in the beginning the more and more I add to it will prove just how far I've come once I complete this course. 
## The reason I built this project was to gain experience working with advanced CSS styling techniques as well as building my comfort with html.
